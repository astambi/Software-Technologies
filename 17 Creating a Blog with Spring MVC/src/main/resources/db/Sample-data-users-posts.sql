But measuring the value of data is not constrained by those transactional limitations. In fact, data currency exhibits a network effect, where data can be used at the same time across multiple use cases thereby increasing its value to the organization. This makes data a powerful currency in which to invest. Nonetheless, we struggle to assign economic value to an intangible asset like data. Being able to attach economic value to data is key if we want organizations to truly manage data as a corporate asset.
